# Portfolio Site #

A personal portfolio site I developed with React to introduce myself, showcase some of my work, and provide some ways to get in touch.

# About # 

Overall, my main goal on this project was to strike a balance between aesthetics and minimalism, while also emphasizing accessibility and responsive sizing for each section. It took a fair amount of tweaking, but I am very pleased with the finished product. I think it represents the culmination of my efforts in learning Frontend Development. 

# Features #

- Exciting, yet clean visual aesthetics
- Single page app with multiple sections
- Navigation bar that auto-scrolls to a particular component
- Clear, convise portfolio with GIFs, summaries, and links to both a demo version and each project's repo
- Functional contact form that connects to EmailJS to deliver messages directly to my inbox
