        </div>
        <p>My name is Austin and I'm a Frontend Dev!</p>
        <p>
          I've always had a passion for research, problem solving, and creative
          expression. From making Wordpress sites for family friends in middle
          school to soldering together guitar electronics, planning, testing and
          troubleshooting are simply a way of life for me. Web development has
          given me the opportunity to use my natural dispotion to craft new
          experiences, conveint features, and responsive designs for both myself
          and clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technologies I use include React, Javascript, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap,
          Vite, and Webpack, but I'm always excited to learn something new.
